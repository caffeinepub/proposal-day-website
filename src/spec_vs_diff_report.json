  "summary": "REQ-24 appears implemented in ProposalSection with side-by-side buttons, smaller sizing, preserved click behaviors, and added collision-avoidance logic to prevent the moving No button from overlapping the Yes button. REQ-25 (poem) is only partially evidenced: the diff summary indicates a poem was added, but the provided poem text is not shown, so exact-text and no-overlap acceptance criteria cannot be confirmed from the truncated diff.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-25",
      "requirement": "Poem text must be displayed exactly as provided by the user (same characters and punctuation).",
      "reason": "The diff summary mentions a \"romantic Hindi poem\" was added, but the actual poem lines are not visible in the provided truncated ProposalSection diff, so exact matching to the user-provided poem cannot be verified.",

      "reason": "No responsive/layout handling for the poem relative to the message/buttons/celebration is visible in the truncated diff; the file summary asserts it, but there is no concrete code evidence provided here to confirm the no-overlap behavior in both normal and celebration states.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest requires rendering the user-provided poem exactly as given. The diff summary claims a Hindi poem was added, but the user-provided poem content is not included in the request or visible in the diff snippet, so adding a particular poem may be unrequested/incorrect.",
