  "summary": "REQ-21 appears implemented (timeline title updated exactly). REQ-22 appears implemented via updated global warm background palette/gradient and enhanced Hero styling. REQ-23 likely implemented (proposal logic preserved and repo summary claims smaller buttons), but the ProposalSection diff is truncated so the actual button size changes are not directly verifiable from the shown code snippet alone.",

    {
      "description": "Changes to horizontal timeline navigation hook (useHorizontalTimelineNav) which is not part of the requested timeline wording, hero/background styling, or proposal button sizing work.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest does not mention horizontal timeline navigation behavior or types; this appears to be an unrelated refactor/fix.",

      "reason": "REQ-21 only requests changing one milestone title and explicitly cautions not to modify other timeline content; it does not request Timeline redesign/animation changes.",
