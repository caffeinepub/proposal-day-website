  "summary": "The diff substantially updates the Timeline section with clearer horizontal navigation (hint text + left/right controls) and more distinct date styling, and adds a dedicated navigation hook. However, due to truncation, key implementation details for scroll snapping/scroll container behavior and edge fades cannot be fully verified. The diff also appears to introduce unrelated changes to the Proposal section behavior and broader global theming beyond the Timeline-focused request.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-17",
      "requirement": "If snap behavior is implemented, the scroll position settles cleanly on a card boundary (no awkward half-visible cards after interaction).",
      "reason": "Timeline items have `snap-center`, but the diff excerpt does not show the scroll container having the required scroll-snap container classes/properties (e.g., `snap-x`, `snap-mandatory`) or any other mechanism guaranteeing clean card-boundary settling. The file is truncated before the scroll container markup/classes are shown.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-16",
      "requirement": "Timeline clearly communicates horizontal navigation via at least two visual affordances (e.g., subtle left/right edge fades, an inline hint text like “Scroll to explore →”, visible drag/scroll indicator, or arrow controls).",
      "reason": "One affordance is clearly present (English hint text 'Scroll to explore' with chevron). The second affordance is likely the arrow controls, but the controls implementation is truncated before confirming they render and are positioned non-overlapping; edge-fade overlays are only mentioned in a separate summary file, not shown in the code excerpt.",
