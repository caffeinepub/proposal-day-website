# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the horizontal Timeline section immediately understandable as horizontally scrollable, easier to scan for date/time, and more visually polished while staying compact and romantic.

**Planned changes:**
- Add clear horizontal navigation affordances (at least two), such as subtle left/right edge fades plus an inline English hint or lightweight arrow controls.
- Improve each timeline card’s date/time readability and scanability (typography/contrast/spacing) across mobile and desktop without changing any event text or order.
- Add optional non-intrusive navigation helpers (e.g., snap-to-card scrolling and/or left/right controls that advance one card) that work well on touch and mouse/trackpad and don’t overlap content on small screens.
- Refine timeline visual cohesion (alignment, spacing, decorative line/dots) while preserving the existing card layout and reveal/entrance animation style, and avoiding blue/purple tones.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can instantly tell the Timeline scrolls horizontally, can quickly read and compare milestone dates/times, and can move between milestones smoothly with a more premium, finished look.
