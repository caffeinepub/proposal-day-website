# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Improve the Proposal section layout by placing the “Yes” and “No” buttons side-by-side in a centered row with smaller sizing, and add the provided romantic poem with polished, readable formatting.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Proposal section button layout so “Yes” and “No” render on the same centered horizontal row with consistent spacing, and reduce button sizing to avoid oversized appearance or text wrapping on mobile/desktop.
- Preserve all existing Proposal interactions and logic (Yes celebration behavior/effects, No message progression, and No button movement timing), while ensuring the moving No button never overlaps/covers the Yes button.
- Add the user-provided romantic poem to the Proposal section as multi-line text with intentional line breaks and spacing, ensuring it doesn’t overlap the headline, messages, buttons, or the celebration view.

**User-visible outcome:** In the Proposal section, the “Yes” and “No” buttons appear smaller and aligned side-by-side; the romantic poem is displayed exactly as provided and remains readable without interfering with the existing proposal interactions or celebration view.
