# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Refine copy and styling on the single-page site by correcting one Timeline milestone title, improving the site-wide background and Hero presentation (warm/romantic, no blue/purple), and reducing Proposal button sizes without changing behavior.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Timeline milestone title from “First time she came to my home” to exactly “First time you came to my home”, without altering any other Timeline content.
- Adjust global background styling to a cohesive warm/romantic palette (avoiding blue/purple tones) and enhance the Hero section’s visual styling (clean, more impressive) while keeping the existing content and layout.
- Reduce the size of the Proposal “Yes” and “No” buttons (e.g., padding/font size) on mobile and desktop while preserving all existing interactions and keeping the moving “No” button visible and non-overlapping.

**User-visible outcome:** The Timeline text reads correctly, the page background and Hero section look more polished and romantic (without blue/purple hues), and the Proposal buttons appear appropriately sized while working exactly as before.
